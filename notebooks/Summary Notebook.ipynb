    "#### Web Scraping: \n",
    "By scraping through www.domain.com.au, we obtained around 9000 records of rental information. These include all internal features related to a property, they are: \n",
    "- rental price\n",
    "- number of bedrooms/bathrooms/parking\n",
    "- size\n",
    "- address\n",
    "- location coordinates\n",
    "- type (house, studio, apartment .etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some external features are also obtained using web scraping because there exists no ready-made dataset, they are:\n",
    "- location of shopping centres (by suburb)\n",
    "- distance of properties to CBD\n",
    "- Suburb-SA2-LGA mapping (since data are recorded under different scales)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Direct Download: \n",
    "some dataset already has machine readable format online, we can directly download them, these include:\n",
    "- location of hospitals (by suburb)\n",
    "- location of entertainment facilities (by suburb)\n",
    "- population record from 2001~2021 (by SA2)\n",
    "- income record from 2005~2018 (by SA2)\n",
    "- location of schools (by suburb)\n",
    "- crime rate (by LGA)\n",
    "- location of train station (by suburb)\n",
    "- median rental price from 2000~2021 (by suburb)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that the last two dataset are manually added to data folder instead of downloading using script, because there was no direct download link available_\n",

    "- Do further preprocessing, making data available for three questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difficulties and Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Difficulty**: Datasets are retrieved from different sources, and all of them have different number of suburbs, for example, there are around 600 suburb extracted from rental properties, and around 2000 suburbs from income dataset, etc. <br>\n",
    " **Solution**: Since the objective is about rental analysis, therefore we decide to use suburbs from rental price dataset as standard. If one dataset does not contain a particular suburb, we estimate it, if one dataset has extra suburb than standard, we discard it. <br>\n",
    " **Flaw**: Since only around 600 suburbs are recorded in rental price dataset, our future research cannot cover most part of Victoria, as shown in geographic visualisations. <br>\n",
    " **Evaluation**: If we preserve all suburbs, there will be lots of missing values across all datasets, and we need to estimate all of them. Therefore, there exists a trade off between accuracy of analysis vs. completeness of data. We assume that accuracy is more important in business context therefore made this decision\n"

    " **Flaw**: Problem is not solved, the overall accuracy of prediction decreases<br>\n",
